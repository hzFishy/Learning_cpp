# Apps
> List of my apps, more info in the `README.md` in each folder

**Note:** If you want to compile yourself please use the same `compile.bat` file located in each App Folder or the App may not have the expected behavior.

**Note 2:** Most Apps require the `default_*` files `.cpp` & `.h` located in this folder (`Apps`)
